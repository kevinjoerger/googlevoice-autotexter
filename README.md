# googlevoice-autotexter
an app to send a bunch of texts (from a script) to a bunch of people, using multiple Google Voice clients. it is functionally the same as copying and pasting a text in the GV interface, as if you were text-banking the normal way, but lets you focus on replies instead of sends.

"Why Use This?"
maybe you have a lot of GOTV or other campaign-based texts you need to send, but you don't want to use Twilio or other paid services. 
you can use this!

all you need is a few Google Voice logins and some people (or just you) to work the replies.

# process for in the field:
- have your trusted texters input their Google Voice login information (need to make this more secure)
- set up the script bodies and, like a beyblade, let 'er rip
- texters will receive responses in their Google Voice accounts, so they can reply from laptop or smartphone.
